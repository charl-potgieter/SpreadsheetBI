TODO
-------     
 - I may need to consider pivotstyles when creating pivot tables from metadata.   Do I want to go as far as saving pivot style attributes or just apply styles that exist in the workbook?

 - Include DAX table queries when generating spreadsheet metadata

  - Remove TableLooper from SpreadsheetBI?   Process is better in seperate spreadsheet "Spreadsheet_Iterative_Model"
 
 - Power Query changing to quotestyleCSV seems to preserve line breaks if there are in quotes.  All fields need to be in quotes

   - The pipe delimited spreadsheet metadata DAX measures are not generating correctly when there are newlines in the measures
     Maybe best option is to remove newlines before writing to the text file
     The Human readable DAX measure file is fine
     The same issue occures in teh listobject metadata exports (both formulas and values) when there is an Alt-enter newline in the cell


  - Create a readme
   
    - For each power query is it possible to save down whether it is loaded to the data model
 
   - Is it worthwhile considering list.accumulate in power query rather than a VBA solution
    * This will also allow easier to transition to power BI
  
- Work on the VBA or power query looper solution depending outcome of above

 
  
 
 - Create a flat pivot style (and apply when flatten pivot table macro is run)
 
  In the date table - is there an issue with using list.dates - see comment from Ken Puls here
