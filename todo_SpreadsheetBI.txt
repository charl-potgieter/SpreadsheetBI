TODO
-------    
Break down EntryPoints.CreateReportFromMetadata into smaller components

Consider creating an (optional) index page (using the existing old-ish code) when more than one report is generated to a new workbook

Listobject class (and calling subs) --> need to protect against errors generated with null data including in transpose functions


 - Remove TableLooper from SpreadsheetBI?   Process is better in seperate spreadsheet "Spreadsheet_Iterative_Model"
 
 - Power Query changing to quotestyleCSV seems to preserve line breaks if there are in quotes.  All fields need to be in quotes

   - The pipe delimited spreadsheet metadata DAX measures are not generating correctly when there are newlines in the measures
     Maybe best option is to remove newlines before writing to the text file
     The Human readable DAX measure file is fine
     The same issue occures in teh listobject metadata exports (both formulas and values) when there is an Alt-enter newline in the cell


  - Create a readme
   
    - For each power query is it possible to save down whether it is loaded to the data model
   
 
  In the date table - is there an issue with using list.dates - see comment from Ken Puls here
